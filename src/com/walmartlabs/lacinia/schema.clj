(defn compile
  "Compiles a schema, verifies its correctness, and prepares it for query execution.
  The compiled schema is in an entirely different format than the input schema.

  The format of the compiled schema is subject to change without notice.

  This function explicitly validates its arguments using clojure.spec.

  Compile options:

  :default-field-resolver
  : A function that accepts a field name (as a keyword) and converts it into the
    default field resolver; this defaults to [[default-field-resolver]].

  :promote-nils-to-empty-list?
  : Returns the prior, incorrect behavior, where a list field that resolved to nil
    would be \"promoted\" to an empty list. This may be necessary when existing clients
    rely on the incorrect behavior, which was fixed in 0.31.0.

  :enable-introspection?
  : If true (the default), then Schema introspection is enabled. Some applications
    may disable introspection in production.

  :disable-checks?  (added in 1.1)
  : If true (defaults to false), certain runtime checks on data returned from field resolvers
    are omitted; this trades safety for speed, but may make sense when running in production.

  :disable-java-objects? (added in 1.1)
  : Normally, Lacinia must check each returned field to see if it is a wrapper around a Java object
    (this happens when a Java objects is tagged via [[tag-with-type]]);
    in most applications, resolvers return only Clojure values, not Java objects, and the step
    that looks for tagged values iis only needed for fields
    whose type is an interface or union. Using this option improves performance slightly, but should be
    used consistently across environments (testing and production).

  :apply-field-directives
  : An optional callback function; for fields that have any directives on the field definition,
    the callback is invoked; it is passed the [[FieldDef]] (from which directives may be extracted)
    and the base field resolver function (possibly, a default field resolver).
    The callback may return a new field resolver function, or return nil to use the base field resolver function.

    A [[FieldResolver]] instance is converted to a function before being passed to the callback.

    The callback should be aware that the base resolver function may return a raw value, or a [[ResolverResult]].
    Generally, this option is used with the [[wrap-resolver-result]] function.

    This processing occurs at the very end of schema compilation.
