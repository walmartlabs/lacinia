   This tutorial is a work-in-progress ... and work has only *just* started.
   It will likely be weeks or months of part-time work.  PR's welcome!

Our goal with this tutorial is to build up the essentials of a full application
implemented in Lacinia, starting from nothing.

Unlike many of the snippets used elsewhere in the Lacinia documentation, this will be something
you can fork and experinment with your self.

Along the way, we hope you'll learn quite a bit about not just Lacinia and GraphQL,
but about building Clojure applications in general.

You can pull down the full source for the tutorial from GitHub: https://github.com/walmartlabs/clojure-game-geek
