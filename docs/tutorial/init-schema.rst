Initial Schema
==============

At this stage, we're still just taking baby steps, and getting our bearings.

By the end of this stage, we'll have a minimal schema and be able to execute our first query.

Schema EDN File
---------------

Our initial schema is just for the BoardGame entity, and a single operation to retrieve
a game by its id:

.. ex:: init-schema resources/cgg-schema.edn

.. sidebar:: Details

  See documentation about :doc:`/objects`, :doc:`/fields`, and :doc:`/queries`.

A Lacinia schema is an `EDN <https://github.com/edn-format/edn>`_ file.
It is a map of maps; the top level keys identify the type of definition: ``:objects``,
``:queries``, ``:interfaces``, ``:enums``, and so forth.
Each type has its own structure.

A schema is declarative: it defines what operations are possible, and what types and fields exist,
but has nothing to say about where any of the data comes from.
In fact, Lacinia has no opinion about that either!
GraphQL is a contract between a consumer and a provider for how to request
and present data, it's not any form of database layer, object relational mapper, or anything
of that type.

Instead, Lacinia handles the parsing of a client query, and guides
the execution of that query, ultimately invoking application-specific callback hooks:
:doc:`field resolvers </resolve/index>`.
Field resolvers are the only source of actual data.
Ultimately, field resolvers are simple Clojure functions, but those can't, and shouldn't, be
expressed inside an EDN file.
Instead we put a placeholder in the EDN, and then `attach` the actual resolver later.

The keyword ``:query/game-by-id`` is just such a placeholder; we'll see how it is used shortly.

We've made liberal use of the ``:description`` property in the schema.
These descriptions are intended for developers who will make use of your
GraphQL interface.
Descriptions are the equivalent of doc-strings on Clojure functions, and we'll see them
show up later when we :doc:`discuss GraphiQL <pedestal>`.
It's an excellent habit to add descriptions early, rather than try and go back
and add them in later.

We'll add more fields, more types, relationships between types, and more operations
as we go.

We've also demonstrated the use of a few Lacinia conventions in our schema:

* Built-in scalar types, such as ID, String, and Int are referenced as
  symbols. [#internal]_

* Schema-defined types, such as ``:BoardGame``, are referenced as keywords.

* Fields are lower-case names, and types are CamelCase.

In addition, all GraphQL names (for fields, types, and so forth) must contain only alphanumerics
and the underscore.
The dash character is, unfortunately, not allowed.
If we tried to name the query ``query-by-id``, Lacinia would throw an exception when we attempted
to use the schema.

In Lacinia, there are base types, such as ``String`` and ``:BoardGame`` and wrapped types, such
as ``(non-null String)``.
The two wrappers are ``non-null`` (a value *must* be present) and
``list`` (the type is a list of values, not a single value).
These can even be combined!

Notice that the return type of the ``game_by_id`` query is ``:BoardGame`` and `not`
``(non-null :BoardGame)``.
This is because we can't guarantee that a game can be resolved, if the id provided in the client query is not valid.
If the client provides an invalid id, then the result will be nil, and that's not considered an error.

In any case, this single BoardGame entity is a good starting point.

schema namespace
----------------

With the schema defined, the next step is to write code to load the schema into memory, and make it operational for queries:

.. ex:: init-schema src/clojure_game_geek/schema.clj

This code loads the schema EDN file, :doc:`attaches field resolvers </resolve/attach>` to the schema,
then `compiles` the schema.
The compilation step is necessary before it is possible to execute queries.
Compilation reorganizes the schema, computes various defaults, perform verifications,
and does a number of other necessary steps.

We're using a namespaced keyword for the resolver in the schema, and in the
``resolve-map`` function; this is a good habit to get into early, before your
schema gets very large.

The field resolver in this case is a placeholder; it ignores all the arguments
passed to it, and simply returns nil.

user namespace
--------------

.. sidebar:: Not too much!

   An annoyance with putting code into the ``user`` namespace is that you can't
   start a new REPL unless and until the ``user`` namespace loads.
   Every so often, you have to go in and comment everything out just to get
   a REPL running, to start debugging an error elsewhere.

A key advantage of Clojure is REPL-oriented development: we want to be able to
run our code through its paces almost as soon as we've written it - and when we
change code, we want to be able to try out the new version instantly.

We can add a bit of scaffolding to the ``user`` namespace, specific to
our needs in this project.
When you launch a REPL, it always starts in this namespace.

We can define the user namespace in the ``dev-resources`` folder; this ensures
that it is not packaged up with the rest of our application when we deploy.

.. ex:: init-schema dev-resources/user.clj

The key function is ``q``, which invokes ``com.walmartlabs.lacinia/execute``.
We'll use that to test GraphQL queries against our schema and see the results
directly in the REPL: no web browser necessary!

With all that in place, we can launch a REPL and try it out::

  14:26:41 ~/workspaces/github/clojure-game-geek > lein repl
  nREPL server started on port 56053 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:56053
  REPL-y 0.3.7, nREPL 0.2.12
  Clojure 1.8.0
  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_74-b02
      Docs: (doc function-name-here)
            (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
    Source: (source function-name-here)
   Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
      Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
   Results: Stored in vars *1, *2, *3, an exception in *e
 
  
  user=> (q "{ game_by_id(id: \"foo\") { id name summary }}")
  {:data #ordered/map ([:game_by_id nil])}

The value returned makes use of an ordered map.
Again, that's part of the GraphQL
spec: the order in which things appear in the query dictates the order in which
they appear in the result.
In any case, this result is equivalent to ``{:data {:game_by_id nil}}``.

That's as it should be: the resolver was unable to resolve the provided id
to a BoardGame, so it returned nil.
This is not an error ... remember that we defined the type of the
``game_by_id`` operation to allow nulls, just for this specific situation.

However, Lacinia still returns a map with the operation name and operation selection.
Failure to return a result with a ``:data`` key would signify an error executing
the query.
That's not the case here at all.

.. [#internal] Internally, `everything` is converted to keywords, so if you prefer
   to use symbols everywhere, nothing will break.
